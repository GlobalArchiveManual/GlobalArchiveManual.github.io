## Data Privacy
All data uploaded to GlobalArchive is held securely within NeCTAR Cloud infrastructure and then encrypted within a secure industry standard database.

Basic metadata (e.g. Campaign name, latitude, longitude, sample id and method) and user information uploaded to GlobalArchive will be discoverable to any registered or un-registered user as outlined in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12G1k2s1qYRwW6g34PSmR67-BaJTSdc63LKZOwiKTZCo/edit#heading=h.vh6d0zinsil4" target= "_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.

Any associated data (e.g. species, count and length) information will not be accessible to any other user unless it is “[Shared](https://globalarchivemanual.github.io/user-access-and-sharing)” with another User by the data [Custodian](https://globalarchivemanual.github.io/user-access-and-sharing).

The [Administrator](https://globalarchivemanual.github.io/user-access-and-sharing) of GlobalArchive, can only delete a User’s data – not access it.

## Data sharing agreements
Formal data sharing agreements will be implemented as part of GlobalArchive “Collaborations”, more information on this coming soon.
