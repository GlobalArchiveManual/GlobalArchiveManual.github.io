The original objective for GlobalArchive was to create a centralised repository for Stereo and single camera fish image annotation, in particular from Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video (stereo-BRUVs) and Diver Operated stereo-Video (stereo-DOVs). Such fish image annotation data, is currently collected by various research, management and academic institutions globally (+100,000â€™s hours of deployments) with varying degrees of standardisation and limited formal collaboration or data synthesis. The [EventMeasure](http://www.seagis.com.au/event.html) software from [SeaGIS](http://www.seagis.com.au/index.html) is the most commonly used approach for annotating such samples, however other approaches exist and have been used historically. There was a need for a mechanism to easily archive and share historical and modern fish image annotations and associated information across projects and institutions to encourage synthesis. The requirement for a repository that could flexibly ingest different forms of data has resulted in GlobalArchive being used to synthesise not only stereo-BRUVs and stereo-DOVs image annotation data but also underwater visual sampling (UVC) and benthic habitat annotation.
