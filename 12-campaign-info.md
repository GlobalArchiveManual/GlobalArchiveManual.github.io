For each Campaign, additional Campaign information on the Sampling and Annotation methods can be included to help with interpretation of data for synthesis and standardisation.

##### <a name="Campaign-information-workflow"></a>Campaign information workflow
1. The Custodian will have to enter the Campaign Information by selecting from a list of predefined PROPERTIES and VALUES that are maintained by the [administrator](mailto:timothy.langlois@uwa.edu.au). 
2. USEFULLY, for subsequent Campaign uploads, this list will be **pre-populated** by your browser and any changes can be made before the Campaign Information is uploaded. **This will speed up the process**.
