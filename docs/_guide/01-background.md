GlobalArchive is designed to be a centralised repository of ecological survey data and associated information. The overarching design principles for GlobalArchive have included ease of use, secure user access, flexible data import, and the collection of any sampling and image analysis information. 
* To share and synthesise data we have implemented data sharing protocols, including Open Data and synthesis Collaborations, and a spatial map to visualise and filter datasets. 
* To extract data, we have implemented a flexible querying protocol that allows relational database-like querying of any data stored as a flat file (e.g .txt file) with associated spatial metadata and sampling information.
