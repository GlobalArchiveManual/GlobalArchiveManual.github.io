#### <a name="User"></a>User
* User registration and login provides secure access to the Campaigns and project you upload and that are shared with you. 

#### <a name="Custodian"></a>Custodian
* The User who creates the Project, and Campaigns within it, is the Custodian. 
* Only the Custodian can upload Campaigns to that Project and share the Campaigns or the entire Project with other Users.
* The Custodian should be the person within the institution with a long term interest in the the data and the person who should be contacted if another user wants to use the data (e.g. will more likely be a Principal Investigator than a research assistant).

#### <a name="Projects"></a>Projects
* Projects are typically to organise data within a research group/organisation (e.g. Monitoring of a specific marine park by the NSW Department of Primary Industries).
* Sharing a Project with another User allows them to query all Campaigns within it.

#### <a name="Collaborations"></a>Collaborations
* Collaborations are designed for ad-hoc sharing of data held within specific Campaigns for syntheses.
* The User who created the Collaboration is the Custodian of the Collaboration.
* Only the Custodian can share the Collaboration with other Users.
* Sharing a Collaboration with another User allows them to query all Campaigns within it.
