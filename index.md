introduction: |
  GlobalArchive is designed to be a centralised repository of ecological survey data and associated information. The overarching design principles for GlobalArchive have included ease of use, secure user access, flexible data import, and the collection of any sampling and image analysis information. 
  - To share and synthesise data we have implemented data sharing protocols, including Open Data and synthesis Collaborations, and a spatial map to visualise and filter datasets. 
  - To extract data, we have implemented a flexible querying protocol that allows relational database-like querying of any data stored as a flat file (e.g .txt file) with associated spatial metadata and sampling information.

## GlobalArchive provides:
* A secure archive of metadata and associated annotation or other data or files, with a focus on stereo techniques
* A standalone database for a [Project](https://globalarchivemanual.github.io/definitions#project)
* Sharing of data in [Project](https://globalarchivemanual.github.io/definitions#Projects) or [Collaborations](https://globalarchivemanual.github.io/definitions#Collaborations)
* Open Data option for public access
* Exploration of metadata and sampling information using a filtered map
* Query data using predefined queries comparable to EventMeasure (e.g. MaxN, Length+3D points) and custom queries.

## Using this guide
In addition to the information provided in this manual we will provide video tutorials that illustrate the steps necessary to import, explore and export data. We plan to add secure external connections to scripted analyses (e.g. R) and have planned for the future integration with online video annotation approaches.
